                    <p class="text-white">Working with photography and film, I am currently exploring narratives about
                        women. My practice is socially engaged and aims to encourage collective participation. I am
                        interested in how invisible forces have power over our lives through images, cultural practices,
                        and language; and within this context, how social change happens.</p>

                        Critics such as Claire Bishop have helped to situate my work and Helena Reckitt made me aware of
                        the need to include participants as collaborators in making the work. She quotes Andrea
                        Fraser,“The institution is us. Every time we speak of the institution as other than us we
                        disavow our role in the creation and perpetuation of its conditions.” (Reckitt, 2013, p146)
                        I did my undergraduate degree at UAL in Graphic Design and worked for many years designing
                        websites for charities before doing an MA in Fine Art At Bath Spa. </p>
